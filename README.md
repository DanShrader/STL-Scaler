# STL-Scaler
Simple project to allow for scaling consistently for 3D printer calibration issues.  In my case with the Monoprice Mini Delta along with AstroPrint.

This is 100% hosted on github as a web application with no additional servers and can be used at the following address:

## Contributing

Since this is a 3D printing project there is a chance that you don't write code, that ok and you can still contribute by filing issues in the project to alert others of bugs.  If you **do** write code, then feel free to file a pull request and contribute back to the project.

## Warning

Like anything with 3D printing **use this at your own risk**.  It's free software, but that does not mean that it's free of bugs.  Check your exported STL files before printing.  There is no warrenty or guarentee that it will work, or that the files will be **right**.

## Road map

- [X] Make the UI consistant
- [ ] Allow for other scaling needs to be addressed and saved in your local memory
- [X] Fix the non-centering print
- [ ] Add a button for 90 dergee rotations on XYZ
- [X] Make the output file name match the input with just a -processed or something like that
